    "## Assignment 1: Intro to EEG Pre-Processing\n",
    "Created By: Alessandro \"Ollie\" D'Amico\n",
    "***\n",
    "**Assigned: 1/19/2019** <br>\n",
    "**Due: 1/25/2019 at 11:59 PM**\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Overview:\n",
    "For this assignment, we will be going over the basics of EEG processing and filtering. The dataset we will be working with was recorded using the OpenBCI Ganglion, an open source EEG amplifier capable of recording four channels of EEG data along with a reference and ground. The data was recorded while a subject performed a standard oddball task.<br>\n",
    "### Oddball Task:\n",
    "Standard visual oddball tasks involve a subject looking at stimuli being presented on a screen. One stimuli is more common than the other. The subject is instructed to count how many times they see the infrequent stimuli. When the participant sees the infrequent stimulus, a response is elicited which can be picked up via EEG. The name of the component elicited by the oddball is known as the visual **P300** or **P3** <br>\n",
    "***\n",
    "***Question 1:*** What does the P in P300 stand for? <br>\n",
    "***Question 2:*** What does the 300 part of the P300 refer to? <br>\n",
    "***Question 3:*** Is the P300 only generated by visual tasks? <br>\n",
    "***\n",
    "This particular experiment consisted of gray disks (RGB 55 55 55) as the non-target (frequent) stimuli, and white disks (RGB 255 255 255) as the target (oddball) stimuli. A small fixation cue was present between stimuli in order to minimize eye movements. The fixation was a circle of RBG (255 0 0). The stimuli were presented for 100ms, and the fixation circle was present for 3000ms between stimuli.\n",
    "### EEG Data:\n",
    "The EEG data collected was sampled at 200 Hz. For those unfamiliar: <br>\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "Hz = \n",
    "\\frac{1}{second}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Which means we collect 200 points of data per second at a data collection rate of 200 Hz.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This is referred to as the **sampling rate**, and is often denoted as \\begin{equation*}\n",
    "F_s \\end{equation*} *Fs* or *fs* is commonly used when writing code.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For this dataset, we will be analyzing data collected from site CPz, which was the site that produced the maximal P300 for this particular subject. 3 other sites were recorded from, but for simplicity, we will only look at a single channel.\n",
    "***\n",
    "***Question 4:*** How many milliseconds (ms) are there between each data point when the sampling rate is 200 Hz? \n",
    "<br>*(Hint: At 1000 Hz, there is 1ms between each data point. At 500 Hz, there is 2ms between each data point.)*<br>\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Section 1: Setup\n",
    "Before we can begin processing our data, we must first import some useful packages. <br>\n",
    "- **numpy** is used widely for processing numerical data, and supports matrix operations natively. We will be using NumPy arrays to store our data.\n",
    "- **scipy** contains useful functions to calculate filter coefficients and carry out filtering. We will be using SciPy filters to clean our EEG data.\n",
    "- **matplotlib** is used to create plots. We will use it to visually explore our filter and EEG data.\n",

    "## Section 2: Filter Design\n",
    "For EEG data analysis, there are various decisions that need to be made when selecting an appropriate filter. All signals are corrupted by outside noise, and EEG data is particularly susceptible to noise from electronics, muscle movements, and skin conductance changes (sweat). Filtering allows us to get rid of some of the junk, but it is not magic. There is no substitute for collecting clean data. Filtering will also throw out some of the data we care about, but this is a relatively small price to pay. <br><br>\n",
    "When selecting a filter, it is often a good idea to review the relevant literature. <br><br>\n",
    "For this assignment, we will be using a standard filter for ERP research known as the Butterworth filter. Butterworth filters aim to remove (attenuate) frequencies which you are not interested in, while leaving the frequencies you are interested in alone. We will be constructing a Butterworth *bandpass* filter. Bandpass filters allow a certain range of frequencies to *pass* through, while other frequencies are attenuated (the opposite of amplified). <br><br>\n",
    "Filter construction requires knowledge of the sampling rate, along with the lower and upper thresholds of frequencies to pass, and an order. We will be choosing **0.1 Hz** as our lowest frequency to pass, and **30 Hz** as our highest frequency to pass. For more information about this type of filter, please refer to: https://github.com/lucklab/erplab/wiki/Filtering"
