    "## Assignment 2: P300 Speller Classification via Linear Discriminant Analysis\n",
    "Created By: Alessandro \"Ollie\" D'Amico\n",

    "## Overview:\n",
    "For this assignment, we will be working with a BCI competition dataset, with the primary goal of classifying target vs non-target trials from a P300 speller. The data we will be using comes from the 2nd Berlin BCI Competition, and was provided by Wadsworth Center, NYS Department of Health (Jonathan R. Wolpaw). Please go to the following link: \n",
    "http://www.bbci.de/competition/ii/\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "We will be working with **Dataset IIb**. Please click on the description of this dataset (pdf format is superior) and read through the page in order to answer the following questions\n",
    "Here is a direct link: http://www.bbci.de/competition/ii/albany_desc/albany_desc_ii.pdf\n",
    "***\n",
    "***Question 1:*** What is the *dt* for the row/column intensification? \n",
    "<br>*(Hint: Remember that from our last assignment, the dt at 1000 Hz = 1ms, 500 Hz = 2ms, 200 Hz = 5ms)*<br>\n",
    "***Question 2:*** How long (in ms) was each row/column intensified?<br>\n",
    "***Question 3:*** How much time (in ms) was there between each row/column intensification?<br>\n",
    "***Question 4:*** What is the sampling rate of the EEG data?<br>\n",
    "***Question 5:*** How many times was each character intensified?\n",

    "*The .gif above is what the actual task looks like. I created the animation following the description of the dataset. As you can tell, these stimuli are being presented in rapid succession. The participant is instructed to only focus on one character at a time, until they are instructed by the task to look at a new character.*\n",
    "***\n",
    "The owners of this data provided us with useful descriptions of the data, along with some matlab code. We will use their documentation to epoch the data so that we can train our classifier. We will be using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for this problem, as it performs very well on P300 paradigms. Furthermore, this algorithm is rather intuitive. We will be using sklearn as it will make this assignment easier to follow.\n",

    "## Section 2: Pre-processing\n",
    "Unfortunately, the data provided to us are in an inconvenient format. The authors saved their entire MATLAB workspace into a .mat for each session. I could not find a way to load in all of these variables into Python. I wrote code to export all of these variables independently in a format we could bring in to Python, but the result was hundreds of files coming in at over 1GB. These data would have been inconvenient to work with in Python, and so I did the pre-processing in MATLAB. The code I wrote is available on this class's GitHub, for those who are curious.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Although the pre-processing was conducted in MATLAB, it is important to know what was done to the data, otherwise this assignment wouldn't make any sense.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "**Step 1: Design a filter**<br>\n",
    "The first thing I did, after creating some variables to store our sampling rate, dt, and number of channels, was to create a filter. I used the filter design from the previous assignment, a 0.1 Hz highpass, and a 30 Hz lowpass second-order Butterworth filter. Just like the previous assignment, I used filtfilt to filter the data, ***but if I wanted to implement this online I would have to just use filt.*** For readibility:\n",
    "- Filter.......: Butterworth, noncausal filtfilt\n",
    "- Order......: 2nd\n",
    "- High pass: 0.1 Hz\n",
    "- Low pass.: 30 Hz\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Determine our epoch, baseline, and window of focus**<br>\n",
    "For the epoch, I decided to use 0ms (stimulus onset) to 500ms after the stimulus onset. This epoch length is effective since there is likely no relevant information after 500ms, and the P300 plot provided by the author seems to agree with this. For the baseline, I chose 0ms to 100ms after stimulus onset. This baseline window was chosen because every epoch contains information from the previous stimulus due to the small amount of time between stimuli. For the window we will select our ERP from, I chose 250ms after the stimulus to 450ms after the stimulus. This choice is consistent with the theoretical expected onset of the P300, and minimizes signals from previous and subsequent stimuli. For readibility:\n",
    "- Epoch...: 0 - 500ms\n",
    "- Baseline: 0 - 100ms\n",
    "- ERP.......: 250 - 450ms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Determine how many signals to extract**<br>\n",
    "There is a lot of mutual information in our data, and it would not be productive to export all of it, specifically because it would take more time to train/cross-validate our model. With this in mind, I decided to ten-fold sub-sample the temporal data, while preseving all 64 channels. I wanted to remain spatially agnostic with these data, although I could have reduced the amount of data by selecting only central + occipital electrodes, for example. With our sub-sampling, we acquire 5 samples per epoch, for all 64 channels, i.e. we obtain a *5 x 64* feature vector for every stimulus. For readibility:\n",
    "- Sub-sampling..........: 10-fold\n",
    "- Samples per epoch.: 5\n",
    "- Number of channels: 64\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a visual explanation of the baseline, ERP window selection, and sub-sampling routine (on a single channel, using the figure provided by the author):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Extract the signals, and markers/labels**<br>\n",
    "After deciding on everything, I extracted the signals and markers of interest. The exact details of this can be found in the MATLAB syntax. I saved the signals in a *5 x 64 x n_stimuli* numpy array, using a helpful function I found online. I saved the labels and markers of the training data in a *n_stimuli x 2* CSV, and the markers of the test data in an *n_stimuli x 1*  CSV. For readibility:\n",
    "- Train signals...............: 'train_df.npy' (5 x 64 x n_stimuli)\n",
    "- Test signals................: 'test_df.npy'  (5 x 64 x n_stimuli)\n",

Similarly, we have 5580 unique observations for our test data. We must restructure our data so that they can be passed into our classifier.
